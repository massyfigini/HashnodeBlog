*These are just my personal notes about the book "The Miracle Morning: The 6 Habits That Will Transform Your Life Before 8AM" by Hal Elrod. Things that are important to me may not be as significant to you, and vice versa. If you are interested in the book, you can buy your copy* [***here***](https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Morning-Updated-Expanded-Not-So-Obvious/dp/163774434X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=23JCZ2I8D4TZQ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.k9QhAD4zlPxeSHjJAs7mmchDSp_-tf_ib2xADVYklznOUZv3-lQoEoYADqYFtOanh5AmhOZ5uE-ZBUrGsP5ywAt-_2LF3C5OynevaXFp7-CtERtcBwISOFIrqbOe9Jx6M61mtlUYOXUAE-SUiOXTIND8U8GRbEkY2CgCTl8g2cwxFSqzq3S0MVeiDrmGoRMfhGuvVfYzRwNzoqwFwzSgDJ0_euOZBUX3MvRJAABm6ZQ.mi0VTQRCsj9jTXLEnR5lknulgJDlUhh9v4aTOEjHLT0&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+miracle+morning&qid=1721022698&sprefix=the+miracle+mo%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-1)*.*

### How to increase your wake up motivation level

1. **Mindful bedtime thoughts**: Your first thought in the morning is usually a reflection of your last thought before bed. Each night, consciously set a positive expectation for the next morning to influence your wake-up motivation.
    
2. **Hydration**: Hydrate immediately upon waking, as dehydration can lead to fatigue. Drinking water first thing in the morning helps boost energy levels.
    

First thing each morning do the SAVERS: Silence, Affirmations, Visualization, Exercise, Reading, Scribing.

### S is for Silence

* Begin each day with purposeful silence to immediately reduce stress levels.
    
* This practice brings calm, clarity, and peace of mind, helping you stay focused on what’s most important.
    
* Purposeful silence can include activities like meditation, prayer, reflection, deep breathing, or practicing gratitude. These activities relax the mind and body, calm the spirit, and allow you to be fully present.
    
* This practice also prepares you to fully receive the benefits of the other life SAVERS practices.
    

### A is for Affirmations

* **The power of self-talk**: Self-talk greatly impacts your success. Affirmations work either for or against you, depending on how you use them.
    
* **Designing effective affirmations**: Write affirmations that align with what you want to achieve and the person you need to become. Repeating affirmations daily out loud influences your subconscious mind.
    
    Avoid focusing on mistakes or negative self-talk, which leads to feelings of inadequacy. Use affirmations to program yourself for confidence and success by repeatedly stating who you want to be and what you want to accomplish.
    
* **Creating your affirmations**: Clarify what you truly want in each area of your life and why it's important to you. Identify who you need to become and which specific actions you need to take to make your vision a reality. Be specific, including the frequency, quantity, and timeframes of the actions.
    
    Add quotes, philosophies, or strategies that inspire you to your affirmations to integrate them into your mindset and behavior.
    
* **Writing and repeating affirmations**: Putting affirmations in writing helps you to move towards a desired mindset. Consistent repetition leads to acceptance by the subconscious mind, which changes thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors over time.
    
* **Emotional connection and physiology**: Tap into your emotions while reading affirmations, and consider incorporating physical gestures like standing tall or making a fist to enhance the impact.
    
* **Continual Updates**: Affirmations are never final - update them as you set new goals or dreams. Remove affirmations that are no longer relevant after achieving goals.
    
* **Consistency is key**: Read your affirmations daily to maintain consistency and effectiveness.
    

### V is for Visualization

* **Definition and purpose**: Visualization involves imagining what you want to achieve and mentally watch the actions required to attain it. It helps focus on future possibilities rather than past failures, pulling you toward a limitless future.
    
* **Daily visualization**: Visualize yourself living your ideal day, completing tasks with ease, confidence, and enjoyment. Visualizing directly after reading your affirmations maximizes alignment with your goals.
    
* **Engage all senses**: Involve all your senses to make the vision vivid. The clearer the vision, the more motivated you'll be to take the necessary actions to achieve it.
    
* **Focus on goals**: Visualize both short-term and long-term goals, and imagine the satisfaction of following through and accomplishing them. Experience the feelings of pride and enjoyment as you see yourself achieving your goals.
    
    Some experts believe that visualizing your goals and dreams can help attract them into your life, making them a reality.
    
* **Alignment with actions**: Create a mental image of yourself living in alignment with the actions necessary to achieve your vision. Visualize yourself enjoying the process and receiving positive responses from others (e.g., co-workers, clients, friends, family).
    

### E is for Exercise

Morning exercise helps wake you up, enhances mental clarity, and sustains higher energy levels throughout the day.

**☺** ***My preference***: Yoga at home when it's cold or rainy, and biking outside when the weather is nice.

### R is for Reading

The fastest way to achieve your goals is to learn from those who have already succeeded in what you want to accomplish. Whatever you want in your life, there are countless books on how to get it.

### S is for Scribing

Scribing (journaling) allows you to capture insights, ideas, successes, lessons, and areas for personal growth or improvement. Journaling each day helps you focus on what you learned, what you accomplished, what you're grateful for, and what you are committed to improving for tomorrow. Also periodically reviewing your entries help you to learn useful lessons and establish new commitments.

### Conclusion

* You must customize your life savers based on your needs.
    
* Example schedule for 60 minutes of Miracle Morning: Silence, Affirmations, Visualization, Scribing: 5 minutes each; Exercise, Reading: 20 minutes each. But you can do even 1-2 minutes for each activity if or when you have no time.
    
* The sequence in which you do them can also be customized to your preference. ☺ ***Best order for me***: Silence - Affirmations - Visualization - Scribing - Exercise - Reading
    

Some other good quotes from the book:

* Success is tied to daily dedication to personal development. Without this commitment, achieving success will be a continuous struggle.
    
* A clear life purpose is essential to overcome mediocrity. Your purpose should inspire you to live in alignment with it every day. Regularly reflect on and define your life purpose.
    
    When committed to a purpose greater than your problems, those problems will seem smaller and easier to overcome.
    
* Mediocrity often comes from seeing actions and choices as isolated incidents. Every thought, choice, and action influences who you become and the quality of your life. Consistently choosing the easy path over the right one shapes your identity negatively.
    
    Choosing to do the right thing, even when it's difficult, develops the discipline needed for extraordinary results.
    
* Leave the past in the past and act to make your life exactly the way you want it to be, starting today.
    
    You can decide now that your life purpose is to become the person you need to be to create the success, freedom, and quality of life you truly want.
    
* Always remember that who you are becoming is far more important than what you are doing, and yet it is what you are doing that is determining who you are becoming.
    
* We spend too much time thinking about the actions we should be taking to create the results that we want, but then we don't take those actions. We all know what we need to do we just don't consistently do what we know.
    

### *☺ My Review*

*(2025-01-10 update) I consider this a good introductory book about the six practices, the SAVERS. However, when I read this book, I already knew these practices from other self-help books, so it didn’t give me much new insight (for example, Unlimited Power by Tony Robbins explores all of them in much greater depth). But the simple idea of practicing all the SAVERS every morning as the first thing of the day is proving to be life-changing for me, and for this reason, I’m grateful to the author, Hal Elrod. Also, the author’s life story shared in the book is truly inspiring - it’s worth reading the book for this reason alone, though there’s more to gain from it.*

☺ *My rating:* ★★★★☆
